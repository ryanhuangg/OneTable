Getting started:

The library does not rely on any external libraries other than jQuery. There are no other CSS files or modules required. To get started, place this inside your website's JavaScript file:
```
const table = new TableGenerator();
table.makeTable(document.getElementById("placeholder"));
```
Replace "placeholder" with the div that you would like to place your table under. All of the API functions are accessed through the variable that the TableGenerator function creates.
